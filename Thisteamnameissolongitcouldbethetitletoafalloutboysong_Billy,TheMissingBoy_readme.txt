Team: This team name is so long it could be the title to a fall out boy song
Game: Billy, The Missing Boy
Members: Linsey Chen, Jieun Seong, Eduardo Rodriguez, Kaitlyn Werho, Jacquelyn Burlison
Start Scene: startGame

How to Play:
Directional Arrows/WASD: Movement in the given direction
Q: Punch
V: Magic attack
E: Interact with something (yellow circle on the ground indicates you can interact here)
Space: Jump
Mouse Click: Go to next piece of dialogue
Escape: Open in-game menu screen
* Note that moving the mouse controls the camera

Upon selecting start new game from the startGame scene, the player will enter the "project" scene, where the gameplay takes place. The dialogue box on the screen will welcome the player and alert them of the first mission: meet up with friends. The player should then find their friends (they are visible upon the start of the scene) and click "E" near the yellow circle on the ground. Note that the player can only interact here if at least one of the friends has already arrived. Upon clicking "E", a dialogue box will open and inform the player of their second mission: find a missing boy. After the dialogue has finished, the NPC friends will eventually leave to go search for him, walking to a variety of waypoints. The missing boy turns out to be a zombie which will follow and attack the player within a certain distance, and he is initially located behind a building on the left. To fight the zombie, the player must use either Q or V to attack, which will lower the zombie's health bar. The zombie will eventually stop following the player if the player gets far enough away. There are also items located on the road near the start of the scene. By colliding with the objects, the player can add them to inventory. To view the inventory, navigate to the in-game menu screen by clicking Escape and then click "Inventory." From the in-game menu screen, one can also restart or close the game. 

Known Problem Areas:
- Dialogue system needs to be further refined in various ways. For example, if the player does not click through the dialogue at the beginning, the dialogue with the friends will not function correctly. Additionally, the NPC friends will eventually leave without finishing dialogue if the player does not click through the dialogue with them. Finally, we would also like to add buttons to the dialogue box so that the player can influence the dialogue and narrative.
